This code performs data preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization, and implements a simple linear regression model to predict a target variable based on given features. The steps include loading the dataset, handling missing values, creating a new feature, visualizing the data, calculating correlations, and finally training and evaluating a linear regression model.
 Steps:
Import Libraries:The necessary libraries are imported, including pandas and numpy for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, and scikit-learn for modeling and evaluation.
Load Dataset:The dataset is loaded from a CSV file named 'data.csv' into a pandas DataFrame.
Initial Data Exploration:Basic information and statistical summary of the dataset are printed.
Handle Missing Values:Missing values in the dataset are filled with the mean of each column.
Feature Engineering:A new feature is created by multiplying two existing features ('feature1' and 'feature2').
Data Visualization:
   Distribution of New Feature:A histogram with a kernel density estimate (KDE) is plotted to show the distribution of the newly created feature.
   Correlation Matrix:A heatmap is plotted to show the correlation matrix of all features in the dataset.
Prepare Data for Modeling:The features ('feature1', 'feature2', and 'new_feature') and the target variable ('target') are selected. The data is split into training and testing sets with an 80-20 split.
Train Linear Regression Model:A linear regression model is trained using the training data.
Make Predictions:Predictions are made on the testing set.
Evaluate Model:The model's performance is evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Visualize Predictions:A scatter plot is created to compare the actual target values with the predicted values.

This code demonstrates a typical workflow for data analysis and machine learning, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization, model training, and evaluation. The Linear Regression model is used to predict the target variable, and the model's performance is assessed using the Mean Squared Error.
